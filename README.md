# Bikeshop Sales Force

## Summary

This project started as a challenge for a Full Stack Dev certification, and instead of just leaving it as that I decided to continue the project for practicing purposes, hopefully turning this info a full functional website that sells bikes (I'll probably leave it as a template for future projects, as reference).

## Contributing
Not sure if someone will see this project, but I'd like to see recommendations. I'm still learning and I'm aware that this project is still a mess, so hearing about good practices, recommended libraries, the way stuff is done and structured, anything will be really appreciated.
